- 👋 Hi, I’m @Spudicus13

- 👀 I’m interested in all things crypto, sql, and of course, programming. 

- 🌱 My main focus for the past few months has been learning PowerShell and really pushing what I can do with it in a Systems Admin role that for a company that seems to have 
  dipped their hand into a pile of different cookie jars, both cloud and private, and somehow smashed them together into a functioning environment. The heavy focus most 
  recently has been PowerShell in the VMware environment. 
  
  For the future, I have been working on continuing to improve CompleteServe and work my contacts in my previous industry and develop more relationships on a SaaS level, 
  rather than the Operations Manager they were used to seeing.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything and everything. A lot of my spare time is involved in the crypto space, and there is so much to learn that the opportunity 
  to be involved in it in any way and continue to grow that side of myself is something that I am always looking for.
  
- 📫 How to reach me ... ping me here, or if you have my email that works as well.
